# shadowsocksrr-libev-git

A fork of [eatradish's aur package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shadowsocksr-libev/), suitable for [shadowsocksrr-libev](https://github.com/shadowsocksrr/shadowsocksr-libev).

Attention, this branch may be different from the original version or any other backup versions of SSR, and we will not provide any guarantee of its compatibility.

CHANGELOG 2017-08-27:
- Update upstream URL to Akkariiin's ShadowsocksRR.
- Update systemd service file name to 'shadowsocksr'.

CAUTION:
- Due to pervious version of ShadowsocksR-Libev, as the executable are named 'ss-*', it is conflict with `community/shadowsocks-libev` and `aur/shadowsocksr-libev`.
